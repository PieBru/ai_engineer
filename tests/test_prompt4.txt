Generate a single HTML file for a "HexaBounce" animation.

Core Task: Create a 2D physics simulation where a ball bounces realistically inside a continuously rotating hexagon.

Key Elements:

Rendering: Use HTML5 Canvas.
Visuals:
Hexagon: Rotating, outlined.
Ball: Circular, styled, bounces off hexagon walls.
Scene: Centered, appealing background.
Physics & Animation (JavaScript):
Realistic ball movement (gravity, friction/damping).
Accurate collision detection with rotating hexagon sides.
Smooth animation loop (requestAnimationFrame).
User Controls (HTML & JS):
Sliders to adjust gravity, friction, and hexagon rotation speed in real-time.
Output: Single HTML file containing all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
