Generate a single HTML file that creates a "Solar Cube" visualization. The primary goal is to display a 3D cube that rotates continuously, and within this cube, a 2D animated representation of a simplified solar system (a central sun and a few orbiting planets) should be visible and appear to rotate along with the cube.

Core Requirements:

Single File Output: All HTML, CSS (embedded in <style> tags), and any necessary JavaScript (embedded in <script> tags, preferably at the end of the body) must be contained within this single HTML file.

3D Scene & Rotating Cube:

Establish a 3D perspective for the scene.
The main element is a 3D cube that continuously and smoothly rotates in 3D space (e.g., around its X and Y axes).
The cube's faces should be visually distinct (e.g., using semi-transparent backgrounds, borders) and could optionally display simple labels.
Ensure transform-style: preserve-3d is used appropriately for the cube and its container.
Embedded 2D Solar System:

Inside the 3D cube, render a 2D representation of a simplified solar system. This solar system model must be a child of the cube in the DOM so that it rotates along with the cube.
Sun: A centrally located, visually distinct sun (e.g., with a glowing effect).
Planets: Several planets (e.g., 3-4) of varying sizes and appearances, each orbiting the sun.
Orbital Animation: Each planet should animate in a circular orbit around the sun at a unique speed and orbital distance.
Visual Orbits (Optional): Consider adding visual cues for the planets' orbital paths (e.g., faint circular lines).
Styling & Layout:

The overall page background should be dark (e.g., black) to simulate space.
The entire 3D scene (containing the cube) should be centered on the page, both horizontally and vertically.
The page should not have scrollbars.
Technology Constraints:

Use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Prioritize CSS for animations where possible. JavaScript should be minimal and used only if necessary for complex animation setups or interactions not easily achievable with CSS alone.
Objective: The final output should be a visually engaging animation where a self-contained solar system appears to be housed within a perpetually rotating 3D cube.
