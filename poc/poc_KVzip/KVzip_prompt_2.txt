Do you think it's architecturally possible to use LiteLLM for inference while keeping KVzip features?

Yes, it's architecturally possible to use LiteLLM for inference while leveraging KVzip's KV cache management features, but it requires a custom integration rather than an out-of-the-box configuration.

Here's a breakdown of why and how:

Understanding the Core Components:

KVzip: This library works by directly interacting with a specific Hugging Face model instance loaded in your Python environment. It manages the model's Key-Value (KV) cache through operations like prefill() (to load context into the cache), prune() (to compress the cache), and generate() (to produce text using this managed cache). The crucial part is that KVzip's generate method uses a specific kv object representing the state of the compressed cache.
LiteLLM: This library provides a unified interface to call various LLM APIs (like OpenAI, Ollama, or other hosted models). It abstracts the model interaction, typically sending prompts/messages to an endpoint and receiving completions. LiteLLM itself doesn't usually manage the fine-grained internal state (like a KV cache) of the models it calls, especially if they are remote.
The Challenge for Integration:

To make LiteLLM's inference benefit from KVzip's compressed cache, the LiteLLM call must ultimately trigger a generation process that uses the KVzip-managed model instance and its specific kv (cache) object. Standard LiteLLM calls are generally stateless from the perspective of a modifiable, client-side KV cache.

Architectural Approaches for Integration:

Here are a couple of ways you could architect such an integration:

Custom LiteLLM Provider: This is likely the most "LiteLLM-idiomatic" approach. You would develop a custom provider class that LiteLLM can use.

Encapsulation: This provider would initialize and manage an instance of KVzip.model.ModelKVzip.
State Management: It would need to handle the lifecycle of the kv cache object. This might involve strategies for associating a kv cache with a particular conversation or context. For example, when LiteLLM calls completion with a set of messages:
The provider could use the initial messages (or a system prompt indicating context) to prefill and prune a kv cache.
Subsequent messages in the same "session" would use this kv cache for generation via ModelKVzip.generate().
Interface Mapping: The provider's completion method would translate LiteLLM's input (model string, messages, parameters like temperature, max_tokens) into the appropriate calls on the ModelKVzip instance and map the output back to LiteLLM's expected response format.
Usage: You'd then use LiteLLM like: litellm.completion(model="my_kvzip_provider/qwen2.5-7b-kvzip", messages=...).
Service Wrapper for KVzip-Enabled Model: You could create a web service (e.g., using FastAPI) that wraps your KVzip.model.ModelKVzip instance.

API Endpoints: This service would expose API endpoints for:
Initializing/loading context (which internally calls prefill and prune on the ModelKVzip instance and stores the resulting kv object).
Generating text (which takes a prompt and uses the stored kv object with ModelKVzip.generate()).
LiteLLM Configuration: Configure LiteLLM to call this custom service. If your service mimics an existing API that LiteLLM supports (like the OpenAI API format), LiteLLM can call it as if it were a standard OpenAI model, for example.
python
# In your FastAPI service:
# - Endpoint to load context and create/store a 'kv_cache_session_id'
# - Endpoint like /v1/chat/completions that retrieves the kv_cache for a session
#   and uses ModelKVzip.generate(..., kv=retrieved_kv_cache)

# In your client code using LiteLLM:
# litellm.api_base = "http://your-kvzip-service-url/v1"
# litellm.api_key = "dummy_or_real_key_for_your_service"
# response = litellm.completion(model="qwen_via_kvzip_service", messages=...)
State Management: The service would be responsible for managing the kv cache objects, potentially associating them with session IDs or users.
Considerations from poc_KVzip.py:

In your poc_KVzip.py script, you initialize KVzip and can process documents using handle_add_command, which populates _active_kvzip_cache. However, the main_chat_loop uses litellm.completion by sending the current_context_text (the original, uncompressed document text) to LITELLM_CHAT_MODEL. In this setup, LiteLLM's inference does not directly use the _active_kvzip_cache that KVzip prepared. The two systems operate in sequence but not in an integrated way for the inference step that would benefit from the compressed cache.

Conclusion:

While not a plug-and-play scenario, it is architecturally feasible. The key is to create a bridge where LiteLLM's calls can control and utilize a KVzip.model.ModelKVzip instance along with its managed KV cache. The custom provider or a dedicated service wrapper are the most promising paths for such an integration. This would allow you to combine LiteLLM's convenient interface and multi-model support with KVzip's specialized KV cache compression for compatible local models.
